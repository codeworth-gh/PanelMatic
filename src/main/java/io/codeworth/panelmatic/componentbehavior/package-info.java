 * The behaviors use {@link java.awt.ComponentOrientation} semantics, which might
 * be slightly confusing at the beginning, but allow for localization. Instead of
 * top-to-bottom and right-to-left, they use page axis and line axis. For English
 * locales, for (probably the most useful) example, things in lines go
 * left-to-right and the lines go top-to-bottom on pages.
