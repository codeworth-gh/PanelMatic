**An intuitive library for creating complex https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/index.html[Java Swing] layouts.**

== Overview

PanelMatic is a mature Swing helper library, created to allow easy creation of complex, high-quality layouts. A panels can be created using a single expression, whose structure directly relates to the way said panel looks.

PanelMatic It is highly customizable, supports right-to-left layouts, and provides an easy way of adding uniform listeners to panel components. The latter is useful, e.g., when one wants any change in a set of text fields to enable a "save" button.

[TIP]
====
A PanelMatic intro https://www.mbarsinai.com/blog/?p=146[is available at mbarsinai.com].

Many panel examples are available at the link:src/test/java/io/codeworth/panelmatic/examples[Examples directory] at the project's tests.

=== Sample Layouts (and the code that creates them)

.A simple login form

=== Important Classes

The below diagram suggests which classes are more important for client code, and which could be safely ignored.

=== Single Expression Panels

The following examples show how PanelMatic's fluent API allows creation of a panel using a single expression.

[source, java]
----
System.out.println("A panel with two JLabels would "
				+ "have a preferred height of "
				+ PanelMatic.begin()
					.add( new JLabel("Label 1"))
					.add( new JLabel("Label 2"))
					.get()
					.getPreferredSize().height
			+ " pixels.");
----

output:

----
A panel with two JLabels would have a preferred height of 40 pixels.
